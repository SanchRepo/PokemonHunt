PokemonHunt
Concept: As a long time pokemon fan, I thought it would be fun to make a website that would benefit people living in the world of pokemon. Let's say there was a pokemon that you as a trainer failed to catch, but your pokedex captured some info on it. You could post that info onto this site along with the location, so that other trainers could help you find it.

The main purpose of this site is just to utilize some of the Web Development skills that I learned. So definitely not an actual site that people in our world is going to use. I'll update this with more info as a go!

Tools at the moment in mind: Javascript HTML CSS EJS MongoDB/Mongoose NodeJS Express
